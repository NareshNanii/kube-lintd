## K8S-CT-001 â€” Missing resource limits
**Severity:** `warning`

**Description:**

Containers should explicitly define CPU and memory limits to prevent resource contention and overcommitment.

## K8S-CT-002 â€” Privileged mode enabled
**Severity:** `high`

**Description:**

Privileged containers have full access to the host. Avoid unless absolutely necessary.

## K8S-CT-003 â€” imagePullPolicy set to Always
**Severity:** `info`

**Description:**

'imagePullPolicy: Always' is best avoided for static pods or when image tags are versioned explicitly.

## K8S-CT-004 â€” readOnlyRootFilesystem not enabled
**Severity:** `info`

**Description:**

Enables immutability within the container and reduces risk of tampering.

## K8S-CT-005 â€” Image has no tag
**Severity:** `warning`

**Description:**

Always pin images with a tag to avoid pulling unintended versions.

## K8S-CT-006 â€” Using latest tag
**Severity:** `warning`

**Description:**

Avoid using the 'latest' tag in production as it can lead to non-deterministic deployments.

## K8S-PD-001 â€” Pod running as UID 0 (root)
**Severity:** `high`

**Description:**

Run pods as non-root wherever possible to reduce security risks.

## K8S-PD-002a â€” hostNetwork enabled in Pod spec
**Severity:** `warning`

**Description:**

Avoid using hostNetwork unless specifically required, as it exposes the Pod to host-level networking.

## K8S-PD-002b â€” hostNetwork enabled in Pod template
**Severity:** `warning`

**Description:**

Avoid using hostNetwork in controllers like Deployment or DaemonSet templates.

## K8S-PD-003 â€” Duplicate image usage across containers
**Severity:** `info`

**Description:**

Consider using separate images for distinct responsibilities within a Pod.

## K8S-YAML-001 â€” YAML parsing failed
**Severity:** `high`

**Description:**

The provided YAML file is syntactically invalid. Check indentation and formatting on the indicated line.
